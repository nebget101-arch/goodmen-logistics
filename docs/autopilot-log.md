## 2026-06-10T13:13 — frontend tick

**Result:** PR_OPENED FN-1204

- Queried Jira for `agent:frontend` tasks in Selected for Development — found 2 candidates (FN-1259, FN-1291)
- Selected FN-1259 (oldest; no file conflicts with in-progress work)
- Created `integration/FN-1204` from `origin/dev` (first subtask agent)
- Created worktree `.claude/worktrees/FN-1259` on branch `frontend/FN-1259/driver-portal-shell` from `origin/integration/FN-1204`
- Implemented 8 new files: `DriverPortalShellComponent` (dark-theme nav, touch targets ≥44px, WCAG 2.1 AA), `IncidentListComponent` (status badges, time-since-opened, filter bar, loading/empty/error states), `driver-portal.routes.ts`, spec (10 tests: render, filter, timeSince)
- Transitioned FN-1259 → In Progress; set assignee Neb Get
- Transitioned parent story FN-1204 → In Progress; epic FN-1157 → In Progress (first child)
- Committed 9 files (8 components + story doc); pushed subtask branch; rebased on integration/FN-1204 (clean); ff-merged into integration/FN-1204
- Transitioned FN-1259 → Done; added branch comment to Jira

**Self-review verdict:** APPROVE
**Auto-merge gate:** ❌ BLOCKED — new Angular components under `frontend/` (UI changes require human smoke-test on mobile viewport before merge)
**Next step:** Human review and merge of PR #806; then wire `DRIVER_PORTAL_ROUTES` into `app-routing.module.ts`

**Sibling summary:**
- FN-1259: Done ✓
- FN-1260: Canceled (not blocking)

**Parent Story:** FN-1201 (Roadside v2 Story 5.1: vendor onboarding API + admin UI)
**Branch:** `backend/FN-1249/vendor-crud` off `origin/integration/FN-1201`

**Work done:**
- Created `roadside_vendors` migration (JSONB base_location — no PostGIS, consistent with geofences)
- Implemented `roadside-vendors.service.js` with list, getById, create, update, setStatus, stats
- Implemented `roadside-vendors.js` route with GET/POST/PUT/PATCH + /stats; write ops require admin role; tenant scoping (private + marketplace)
- Added gateway proxy rule `/api/logistics/vendors` → logistics-service
- Mounted route in logistics server.js at `/api/logistics/vendors`
- Added unit tests
- FF-merged into `integration/FN-1201`

- FN-1250 (database): Selected for Development (pending — migration already included in FN-1249)
- FN-1251 (frontend): Done ✓
- FN-1252 (qa): Canceled

**Next step:** FN-1250 sibling must complete (or be skipped since migration is included) before `create-pr FN-1201` can open the integration-branch PR.
